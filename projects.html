    comments also store it Time and Date.  Specially a most important is I use JWT(json web token)its used for login and 
    it genrate a password and it is a standard method for representing claims securely between two parties. 
    It is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties, such as a client and a server. JWTs are

            This project is divided into 4 features namely User, Product, Cart and Order. 
            You need to work on a single feature at a time.
            Once that is completed as per above mentioned steps. You will be instructed to move to next Feature.
            And we are changing how we send token with a request. Instead of using a custom header key like x-api-key, 
            you need to use Authorization header and send the JWT token as Bearer token.We also used AWS as Stored the data on cloud.

    <h3>Key Features:Use ShortnerURL For Memorizing  The
        Long  URL</h3>
        <p><h4>Description:</h4>
            In This project Scalable URL Shortner Project Requirement Phase I Overview URL shortening is used to create shorter aliases for
            long URLs. We call these shortened aliases “short links.” Users are redirected to the original URL when they hit these short links. 
            Short links save a lot of space when displayed, printed, messaged, or tweeted. Additionally, users are less likely to mistype shorter 
            URLs. In Project also used "Redis" is an Remot dictonary it is an open-source, in-memory data structure store. It is often used as a
            database, cache, and message broker, and is particularly well-suited for applications that require high-speed data access, low latency,
            and real-time performance.
